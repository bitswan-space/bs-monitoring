# Introduction

BS Monitoring is a light-weight monitoring library designed for monitoring of various services and data-flows. It supports a wide range of data sources and alert services, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.
It is designed to be easily extended with new components that fit nicely into the existing architecture. Configuration is done via a yaml file which constructs the whole monitoring pipeline.
